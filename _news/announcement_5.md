I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed all six labs, including the bonus lab, in the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, finishing 11th. You can view my certification on <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/2defe52b-c725-4109-8d66-e8718fd29d08/public_url">Credly</a> and my solution notebooks on <a href="https://github.com/AsadullahGalib007/IBM-Quantum-Challenge-2024-Solution">GitHub</a>.
