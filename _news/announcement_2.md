I am thrilled to share that I got nominated for the Womanium Quantum Solution Launchpad (QSL) fellowship. I am particularly excited about the prospect of working as a research fellow with the Fraunhofer ITWM. Among 4300 participants, only 22 were nominated, and I am fortunate to be one of them. After undergoing 13 weeks of rigorous training, completing assignments, and demonstrating excellence in the Quantum Machine Learning (QML) project, I have secured this position. Here is the <a href = "https://github.com/AsadullahGalib007/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production">GitHub link</a> to my project work. Validate my badge for completing the program on <a href="https://www.virtualbadge.io/certificate-validator?credential=825e074b-9a47-467b-b6d1-2c81ec97d97d">virtualbadge.io</a>.
