## Govt. Shahid Akbar Ali Science and Technology College (SASTC)
*March 2023 â€“ September 2023*

During my tenure as a lecturer at Govt. Shahid Akbar Ali Science and Technology College (SASTC), I taught several undergraduate courses in the Computer Science and Engineering department.

## Courses Taught:

### 1. Theory of Computation (CSE257)
- **Level**: Undergraduate
- **Description**: Introduced students to the theoretical foundations of computation. Topics covered included 
finite automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, and complexity theory.

### 2. Computer Graphics and Image Processing (CSE405)
- **Level**: Undergraduate
- **Description**: Covered fundamental concepts in computer graphics, including 2D/3D rendering, transformations, 
and rasterization. The image processing section focused on digital image representation, filtering, and enhancement techniques.

### 3. Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (CSE469)
- **Level**: Undergraduate
- **Description**: Provided students with an introduction to machine learning techniques, 
including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The course also emphasized practical applications 
such as pattern recognition, classification, and clustering.

### Key Achievements:
- Developed and delivered comprehensive course materials, including lecture notes, assignments, and exams.
- Guided students through hands-on projects and practical implementations of core topics.
