I am a Computer Science graduate with a keen interest in Quantum Computing. My expertise includes Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Quantum Computing. Despite not having a formal background in Physics, I have eagerly taken on the challenge of self-directed learning in this advanced field. I participated in the Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 and the Womanium Quantum + AI Global Summer Program, where I excelled and got nominated for the Womanium Quantum Solution Launchpad (QSL) fellowship. Additionally, I participated in the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, where I completed each task and finished with rank 11 globally. Currently, I am enrolled in the QClass24/25 by QWorld for advanced quantum computing coursework. I am now actively seeking opportunities for a second Master's or a PhD in Quantum Computing.

**Research Interests:** Image Processing, Machine Learning, Quantum Information, Quantum Machine Learning(QML), Quantum Key Distribution(QKD). You can read my research statement [here](assets/pdf/Asadullah_Research_Statement.pdf).
